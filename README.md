## Features
The topic, electronic voting systems, is described as “the system should support certain features, e.g., polling, candidate registration, voting, etc.” Therefore, our team created a real-time updating voting website that is open to anyone who has registered an account.

The website has the following features:
1. User registration
Anyone can register an account with his/her email and a password that is more than 6 characters.
2. User login
Anyone with a valid account can log into the voting system and join the voting topics or create his/her voting topic.
3. Multiple voting topics participation
All of the voting topics existed are open for any valid user. An user can have one vote for one topic.
4. Voting topics creation
Any valid user can create his/her voting topic, and he/she can add or remove the options afterward.
5. Voting options alteration (creator-only)
The creator of a topic can add or remove the options after creation. Any other user cannot alter the functions.

All the voting topics and the options’ vote numbers show on the pages are real-time updating.
